# RecyclerViewCheckBoxExample2
Supporting article for the medium tutorial on how to [handle check box states in android recycler view]
(https://blog.oziomaogbe.com/2017/10/18/android-handling-checkbox-state-in-recycler-views.html)

This repository has 3 branches for
1. the default behaviour
2. the behaviour using sparse boolean array
3. the behaviour using the model to hold the state of the view.

This problem would generally not come up when using techniques like two way binding, Live Data or RxJava, but these concepts 
are not generally used by android beginners, so you could use the methods in the article while you learn more advance topics in android.
